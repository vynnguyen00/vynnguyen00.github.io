# About Me!
## **A Brief Introduction**
---
### *Hello, there! My name is Vy Nguyen and I am currently a senior at Texas A&M University. I'm an English major with a pursuing Philosophy minor. My pronouns are she/her and I am 21 years old. (Ahh, yes. The legal age to consume copious amounts of alcohol as a coping mechanism.) Anyways, to be more specific, I'm an English Literature major, mostly focusing on **rhetoric and composition** and **British and American literature**. Happy to get to know you! You can continue reading the lists down below to learn more about me and my interest!*
