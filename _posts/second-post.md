This is my **second post**.

For the lab "What is Style?" we have to write a blog post about the process. This is my account of the lab.

Firstly, this lab was substaintially more difficult than previous ones. I think it has to do with the amount of elements we can mess with and alot of the style elements rely on an understanding of where do you want it to be implemented and how, which just became confusing with the switch to CSS.
Here's an excerpt from my lab report that sums up the process.

Following the guidance of the lab instructions, I added the About Me page from Week 5’s lab to my website. After locating the About Me file on my computer, I opened GitHub in my browser and created a new folder called about and a new file called me.md. I used the example of a YAML metadata block provided by the lab instructions in order to set the page’s title and layout in accordance with my About Me file. Then I committed the changes to my website.  I also added another file called site.md to the about folder. I committed the changes to my website once again. 

Visiting my website, I noticed the changes made two new links appear above my first post as About Me and About This Site. Clicking on them, the information that I had copied and pasted into the respective files showed up.  I then went into the _layouts folder and edited the text above the links to read “Go ahead and click on any link below!”
